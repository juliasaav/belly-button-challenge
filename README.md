# belly-button-challenge
#This project is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
